# French III: La Vengeance de L'escroc Baguette
A very strange console game that I decided to create after someone said that "French III" sounded like a video game. I'm not *entirely* sure why I decided to make this.

## Building:
You can compile this program yourself by running `make` in the directory containing `frenchiii.cpp`. If you don't have make installed, you can just compile `frenchiii.cpp` with `g++`, or whatever the Windows equivalent is if you're using Windows. No special arguments are needed. Note: This is only officially tested to work on Arch Linux, so I'm not sure if it does work on Windows. I try to make the code cross-platform, but there aren't any guarantees since Windows isn't the priority here. Feel free to start an issue if you encounter one.
