# Question 2
Identify the error, if any, in the following code snippet:

```python
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

x = 5
y = '3'
z = add(x, y)
print(z)
```

# Question 3
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

```py
[-21, 89, 101, 35, 36, -22, 91, -53, 36, -65]
```

# Question 4
Write a Python function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.

# Question 5
Design a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

# Question 6
Create a Python program that reads a text file and counts the occurrences of each word in the file, then prints out the words along with their counts in alphabetical order.

# Question 7
Consider the following Python code:

```python
count = 0
for i in range(5):
    for j in range(3):
        count += 1
print(count)
```

How many times is the variable count incremented within this code?

# Question 8

Given the following recursive function in Python:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

What will be the output of factorial(4)?

1. 4
2. 8
3. 12
4. 24

# Qesution 9
Given the recursive function:

```python
def sum_n(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n + sum_n(n - 1)

result = sum_n(5)
print(result)
```

What will be printed when the code is executed?
1. 10
2. 15
3. 20
4. 25

# Question 10
Consider the following code:

```python
count = 0
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        count += 1
        if j == 1:
            break
print(count)
```

How many times is the variable count incremented within this code?

1. 3
2. 4
3. 5
4. 6
